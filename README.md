# TriviaGame
This is a trivia game in which the user answers questions about American history. After the start button is pressed, a function is executed which hides the start button and creates the html elements for the questions using jQuery. As the user answers the questions, the program keeps track of their correct and incorrect answers and unanswered questions. Users can change their answer for each question, with their most recent response used to determine whether their response was right or wrong for that question. A timer is set and runs for 60 seconds using jQuery as well. When the time reaches zero, the user can't provide any more responses. Then all the questions are hidden and the results are displayed for the number of correct and incorrect responses, as well as the number of unanswered questions. I realized that the javascript file could be much shorter, and that I could have created functions to reuse on each question, such as for keeping track of unanswered, incorrect, and correct responses, with far fewer lines of code. I might update the js file later to make these changes.
